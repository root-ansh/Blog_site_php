#  Save my string

a very simple site i made to learn  php backend. this will take a key and value from user and store it in a db. user can retriev the value via its key
I was able to host this website on an (accidentally super costly :P ) aws server  for a few hours, before burning a hole in my pocket xD.

To run in your local host , change the following files in `SMSTableHandler.php` as per your configuration:  

```php

    const SERVER="your servername";
    const S_NAME="your username";
    const S_PASSWORD="yourpassword";
    
    ```
